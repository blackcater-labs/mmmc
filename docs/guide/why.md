# Why Mmmc?

## Motivations

I bought a NAS device a few month ago. So I want to save all resources on it.

You can eazyily find that there are many powerful tools to manage your video, movie, music and photo. But you can't find a good tool to manage your own comics.

So I decide to write a tool to manage comics. Powerful like [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/).

## How is Mmmc Different from X?

You can find many tools to manage your comics in Github. But most of them is out-of-date. Some of them is only for mobile device. Some of them ugly and hard to use.

Mmmc use modern web technology. It's easy to use. It's easy to deploy. It's easy to extend.

### Plex, Emby, Jellyfin

Plex, Emby and Jellyfin are great tools to manage your video, movie, music and photo. But they can't manage comics.

### LANraragi

LANraragi is a great tool to manage comics. But it's not easy to manage comics.

### tachiyomi

tachiyomi is a great tool to read comics. But it's a mobile app. And it's not easy to manage comics.
